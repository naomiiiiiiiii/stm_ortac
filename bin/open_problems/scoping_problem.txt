type t
(*@ model contents: integer *)


(*
requires (can be about the args (including the atom))
any exp about (the args that aren't the sut) has to use functions from outside this file because you demand that all fns in this file take t as first arg
if you write requires (get atom) = 5 my tool can't handle that
but can you write that? yes. i demand in my assumptions that you can't because it refers to the atom directly in any conditions, can only refer to its fields.


   gospel allows you to use functions declared in the same file in a specification
   PROVIDED that those functions are pure
   but the error message is quite misleading
